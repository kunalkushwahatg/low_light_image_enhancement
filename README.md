# Low-Light Image Enhancement with FastAPI
This repository contains a FastAPI application for low-light image enhancement using a pre-trained deep learning model. The application provides a simple and efficient interface for enhancing low-light images with just a few clicks.

## Features
* #### Pre-trained Model:
  <br>The application leverages a pre-trained deep learning model for low-light image enhancement. The model is capable of enhancing low-light images while preserving 
      important details and minimizing noise.<br>
* #### FastAPI Endpoint:
  <br>The FastAPI application exposes a user-friendly endpoint for uploading and enhancing low-light images. Users can easily interact with the endpoint through a web 
      interface or API calls.<br>
* #### Efficient Processing:
  <br>The low-light image enhancement process is fast and efficient, allowing users to enhance multiple images in real-time. The application utilizes the asynchronous 
      capabilities of FastAPI for optimal performance.<br>
